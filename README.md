## Web Scraping
### What is Web Scraping 
Collecting data from websites using an 
automated process is known as web scraping. Some websites explicitly forbid users 
from scraping their data with automated tools like the ones you’ll create in this tutorial. 
Websites do this for two possible reasons:

* The site has a good reason to protect its data. For instance, Google Maps doesn’t let you request too many results too quickly.
* Making many repeated requests to a website’s server may use up bandwidth, slowing down the website for 
other users and potentially overloading the server such that the website stops responding entirely.

Some of the common Web Scraping Methods are:

* Parse website data using string methods and regular expressions
* Parse website data using an HTML parser
* Interact with forms and other website components

We learned about Parsing website data using an HTML parser and we used BeautifulSoup for it.
